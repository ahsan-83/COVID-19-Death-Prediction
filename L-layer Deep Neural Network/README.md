L-layer Deep Neural Network Binary Classification Model is developed from scratch with python for Cat vs non-cat image classification.

# L-layer Deep Neural Network Model Architecture

- Initialize weight and bias parameters for  L-layer deep neural network
- Compute Linear Forward Activation *LINEAR->RELU* for $L-1$ layers and *LINEAR->SIGMOID* for last layer
- Compute the loss with Binary Cross Entropy cost function
- Compute gradients of loss function respect to parameters of hidden layers in Linear Backward Activation
- Update hidden layer parameters for gradient descent using learning rate
